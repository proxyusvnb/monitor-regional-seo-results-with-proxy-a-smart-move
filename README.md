## What is proxy?

Simply put, a proxy acts like a middleman between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your requests are routed through another server, which changes your visible IP address. This means websites see the proxy‚Äôs IP, not yours.

There are different types of proxies, but residential proxies are special‚Äîthey use IPs assigned to real residential devices, making them harder to detect or block compared to data center proxies.

## Benefits of proxy

Why bother using a proxy? Here are a few key reasons:

- **Privacy & anonymity**: Your real IP stays hidden, so you can browse or collect data without easily getting flagged.  
- **Access geo-specific content**: Some websites show different results based on your location. Proxies let you ‚Äúappear‚Äù to be anywhere.  
- **Avoid IP bans**: If you scrape or automate data collection, proxies reduce the chance of getting blocked because requests come from different IPs.  
- **Better data accuracy**: When monitoring things like search engine results pages (SERPs), proxies ensure you get results that reflect the local user experience‚Äînot just your own.

## How can residential proxy help you monitor regional search engine results?

Say you want to see how your website ranks in Germany versus Brazil or Indonesia. If you search from your home IP, Google tailors the results based on your location and search history, which skews data. Residential proxies from 9Proxy let you simulate being in any region you want.

Because these proxies use real residential IPs, Google treats them like normal users. This means your rank checks, keyword research, and competitor analysis become far more accurate and reliable. Plus, 9Proxy offers IP rotation, so you can monitor multiple locations without getting blocked or blacklisted.

This is a game-changer for marketers, SEO specialists, and businesses targeting global audiences. You get authentic, location-specific SERP data, helping you tailor strategies, localize content, and spot market opportunities before competitors do.

## How to choose proxy for monitoring regional search engine results?

Not all proxies are created equal. Here‚Äôs what to look for:

- **Residential IPs**: Avoid data center proxies if you want genuine local results. Residential IPs blend in naturally.  
- **Wide regional coverage**: The proxy provider should offer IPs in many countries and cities, especially your target markets.  
- **IP rotation & pool size**: A large proxy pool with automatic rotation prevents detection and helps scale monitoring efficiently.  
- **Speed & reliability**: Slow proxies slow down your monitoring tools and can cause inaccurate data or failures. Choose fast, stable services.  
- **Easy integration**: Whether you use automated SEO tools or custom scripts, your proxy should be easy to set up and manage.
